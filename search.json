The weights w become the parameters of the filters\n\n\nEach picture contains 3 colors so for every color there are three channels. Due to this the kernels are not 2x2 but most of the times it is 3x3.\nYou can apply different kernels in the same layer which also creates extra depth. This is happening in a different channel. This channel is also called a This depth is why we call it deep learning.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of Slide\n\n\nA pooling layer takes the outcomes of the convulotion layer and applies a kernel over this. In most cases this is a max-pool which selects the highest value. The following image shows an example for this.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of lecture slide of pooling layer\n\n\nThe stride is how many pixels it moves to the left. Stride 2 is therefore jumping over 1 pixel.\nThe low level features are learned in the ealrier layers. The higher level features are learned in later layers.\nA fully connected layer is applied to all of the result to get the final prediction."
